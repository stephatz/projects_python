# Programming assignments from CS with Applications I and II

Here you can find some of the most interesting projects I have worked on as part of the coursework from Computer Science with Applications I and II. Since these assignments are given every year, I can't make public my code but it can be requested to <stephania.tello.z@gmail.com>.

## CS with Applications II

**Markovian Candidate**: using Markov Models, analyze real texts from US politicians and assess the likelihood that a particular politician uttered an actual text. The implementation had to include a hash table data structure, and worked as if it was Python dictionary.

*Skills developed: create a hash table data structure, set up of packages*

**Scraping Chicago Parks**: build a scraper that crawls a simulacrum of the Chicago Parks website to construct a search index.

*Skills developed: HTML scraping*

**Park Search Engine**: build a search engine using SQLite database for the data park collected in the previous assignment (Scraping Chicago Parks).

*Skills developed: SQL queries, sqlite3*

## CS with Applications I

**[Modeling Language Shifts](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa2/index.html)**: based on the language shift model described by Beltran, et al. in their paper A Language Shift Simulation Based on Cellular Automata, the goal was to simulate how language preferences change over time.

*Skills developed: functions, lists of lists, nested loops*

**[Analyzing Candidate Tweets](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa3/index.html)**: analyze tweets sent from the official Twitter accounts of four UK Government parties: the Conservative and Unionist Party (@Conservatives), the Labour Party (@UKLabour), the Liberal Democrats (@LibDems) and the Scottish National Party (@theSNP) during purdah. Type of analysis: favorite hashtags for each account, what words occurred the most often in a party's tweets, etc.

*Skills developed: dictionaries, organization and structure of coding tasks, use of helper functions*

**[Polling places](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa4/index.html)**: simulate the flow of voters through polling places (M/M/N queue) and analyze the interplay the number of voting booths assigned to a precinct and the amount of time voters spend waiting in line.

*Skills developed: design and implementation of classes (methods and use of class instances), write and open files*

**[Linear Regression](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa5/index.html)**: build a model to predict the target value for each sample unit based on the features representing that sample. The model was applied on two datasets to do the following: 1) predict the crime rate in different regions in Chicago from the number of 311 calls; 2) predict California house price based on house features in the census block.

*Skills developed: Numpy, linear regression models*

**[Visualizing Avian Biodiversity Using Treemaps](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa6/index.html)**: create a treemap of bird sightings in Cook County, IL using the hierarchical structure of bird taxonomy. Each rectangle of the treemap represents a single species and the area of the rectangle is proportional to the number of sightings of that species. 

*Skills developed: recursive functions, recursive data structures*
