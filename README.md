# Programming assignments from CS with Applications I and II

Here you can find some of the most interesting projects I have worked on as part of the coursework from Computer Science with Applications I and II. Since these assignments are given every year, I can't make public my code but it can be requested to <stephania.tello.z@gmail.com>.

**[Modeling Language Shifts](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa2/index.html)**: based on the language shift model described by Beltran, et al. in their paper A Language Shift Simulation Based on Cellular Automata, the goal was to simulate how language preferences change over time.

*Skills developed: functions, lists of lists, nested loops*

**[Analyzing Candidate Tweets](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa3/index.html)**: analyze  tweets sent from the official Twitter accounts of four UK Government parties: the Conservative and Unionist Party (@Conservatives), the Labour Party (@UKLabour), the Liberal Democrats (@LibDems) and the Scottish National Party (@theSNP) during purdah. Type of analysis: favorite hashtags for each account, what words occurred the most often in a party's tweets, etc.

*Skills developed: dictionaries, organization and structure of coding tasks, use of helper functions*

**[Polling places](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa4/index.html)**: simulate the flow of voters through polling places (M/M/N queue) and analyze the interplay the number of voting booths assigned to a precinct and the amount of time voters spend waiting in line.

*Skills developed: design and implementation of classes (methods and use of class instances)*

**[Linear Regression](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2022/fall/30121-1/pa/pa5/index.html)**:
